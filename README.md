Building a multi page application (MPA) using view transitions

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── index.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Component.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 📦 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
